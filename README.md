"Hi, what's up? Welcome to my final project. My project includes a pizzeria website, named 'Shesh', offering a variety of salads and pizzas. Now, let's dive into the project – come hungry! There are two parts that need to be set up in my project. Once you enter my project, there is a 'terminal' in the top bar. Click on it, and in the terminal options, select 'split terminal'. This will open two terminals. In one of them, after clicking, you now need to activate the project. The first thing to do is launch the frontend. So, what you do is type 'cd foodi-client' and then 'npm run dev', and that’s it, the frontend is successfully set up! Now, moving on to the backend. There, you type 'cd foodi-server' and then 'npm start', and that’s it, the project is ready for presentation. After you finish, you can register on my site and then you'll be able to buy pizzas and lots of salads! Now, to access the admin, use the email: johndoe@example.com and password: Aa1234!"

#frontend cd foodi-client npm run dev

#backend cd foodi-server npm start

admin: email: johndoe@example.com password: Aa1234!
